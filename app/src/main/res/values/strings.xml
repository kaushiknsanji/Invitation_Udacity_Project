The main attraction is the Glass House that is modeled to resemble London's Crystal Palace, and this is where the major flower decorations are done for the occasion of Republic Day and Independence Day of India. It also hosts Mango festival once in every year. On the other side, Lalbagh is also famous for Pokémon goers as this is a major Pokéfarm too with lots of Pokéstops, and a Pokégym centered at the Glass House."
