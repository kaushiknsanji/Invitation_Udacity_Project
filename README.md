## Design and Implementation of the App

As this is a Single Screen App, it contains only one Activity, i.e., [MainActivity](/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/invitation/MainActivity.java) which displays the details of a particular location of interest (following the Rubric), allowing the user to "Invite Friends" using the dedicated button. This button has no functionality.
